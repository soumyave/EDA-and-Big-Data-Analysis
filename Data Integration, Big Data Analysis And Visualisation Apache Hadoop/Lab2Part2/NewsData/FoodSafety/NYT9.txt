I spent a lot of time alone. I’d go into the woods and build forts and create these huge imaginary scenes.” When he wrote the first volume in his best-selling “Red Rising” series, “I started with the main character and shaped my world around him,” he says. “I was inspired by the plight of Irish immigrants in the 19th century and by the disenfranchisement of working classes.” He’s still dissecting social hierarchies in the fourth book in the series, “Iron Gold,” which debuts on this week’s hardcover fiction list at No. 3: “I’m exploring the lives of people who become casualties despite the best intentions of the story’s heroes.” PICTURE THIS: Two new historical biographies appear this week on the children’s hardcover picture-book list: Brad Meltzer’s “I Am Harriet Tubman,” which enters the list at No. 4, and Margot Lee Shetterly’s “Hidden Figures,” at No. 8. Shetterly — whose 2016 book about black female mathematicians at NASA during the early years of the space race has already been made into a movie and a young-reader chapter book — says she relished bringing her narrative to the 3-to-7 set. “These are the ones who need the story the most,” she explains. “To encourage women and minorities to enter STEM fields, you need to start early.” She adds, “Distilling the story for them in no way means you dumb it down. You simplify concepts, but you don’t assume children can’t understand.” PALACE POLITICS : David Cay Johnston’s “It’s Worse Than You Think” debuts at No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list, where it sits with three other titles about President Trump or his administration. Johnston, a veteran journalist, is not surprised by the appetite for such books. “During the campaign, Donald Trump was like an accident on the other side of the highway, complete with fireworks and a marching band and dancing girls,” he says. “People were not paying attention to who he is; they were too busy watching the spectacle. But now people are saying, ‘Wait a minute. What’s going on here?’” In his book, Johnston says he is trying to show what members of Trump’s administration have been doing for the last year, “undermining rules on things like job safety, food safety, and air and water quality.”   Follow New York Times Books on Facebook and Twitter (@nytimesbooks) , sign up for our newsletter , and sync your calendar with curated literary events .
